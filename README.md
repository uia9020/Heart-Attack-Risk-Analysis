# Heart Disease Predictive Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately classify the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of medical attributes. Utilizing the dataset available on Kaggle ([Heart Disease Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/data)), this endeavor seeks to provide valuable insights into heart disease prediction and contribute to preventive health care measures.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of several medical attributes that are indicative of heart disease presence. These attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, rest ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and more. For detailed information on the dataset, including feature descriptions and data preparation, please visit the dataset page on Kaggle.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on their medical attributes. By doing so, we aim to aid in early detection and potentially save lives through timely intervention.

## Usage
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the analysis and prediction models:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective:** Understand the dataset by analyzing its statistics and visualizing the data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Load the dataset.
  2. Use descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's central tendencies, dispersion, and shape.
  3. Visualize the data with plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand distributions and relationships between variables.

### Preprocessing
- **Objective:** Clean the dataset and prepare it for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Identify and handle missing values.
  2. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  3. Normalize or standardize numerical features.

### Model Training
- **Objective:** Train various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  2. Select a model to train, such as logistic regression, SVM, or a neural network.
  3. Train the model on the training set and save the trained model for evaluation.

### Evaluation
- **Objective:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Use the test set to predict outcomes using the trained model.
  2. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  3. Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

### Prediction
- **Objective:** Use the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Prepare the new data for prediction by following the preprocessing steps.
  2. Load the best-performing model.
  3. Use the model to make predictions on the new data.
