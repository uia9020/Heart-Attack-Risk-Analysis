# Heart Attack Risk Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and predictive modeling for the [Heart Attack Risk Analysis competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis). The goal of this competition is to use clinical parameters about a patient to predict the risk of a heart attack.

## Dataset
The dataset for this competition includes several clinical features that might be indicative of a heart attack risk, such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, rest ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and more. The full description of the dataset and the features can be found on the [competition's data page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/data).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is at high risk of having a heart attack. This involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the dataset, selecting appropriate features, training models, and evaluating their performance.

## Usage
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the analysis and prediction models:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective:** Understand the dataset by analyzing its statistics and visualizing the data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Load the dataset.
  2. Use descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's central tendencies, dispersion, and shape.
  3. Visualize the data with plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand distributions and relationships between variables.

### Preprocessing
- **Objective:** Clean the dataset and prepare it for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Identify and handle missing values.
  2. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  3. Normalize or standardize numerical features.

### Model Training
- **Objective:** Train various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  2. Select a model to train, such as logistic regression, SVM, or a neural network.
  3. Train the model on the training set and save the trained model for evaluation.

### Evaluation
- **Objective:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Use the test set to predict outcomes using the trained model.
  2. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  3. Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

### Prediction
- **Objective:** Use the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Prepare the new data for prediction by following the preprocessing steps.
  2. Load the best-performing model.
  3. Use the model to make predictions on the new data.
